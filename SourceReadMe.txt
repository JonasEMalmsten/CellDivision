The main program is stored as a Jupyter notebook: CellDivision.ipynb
If you don't have Jupyter installed, you can also view the HTML version: CellDivision.html

The notebook allows you to see the results of executing the code without having a large dataset of embryo images. 

There are two require support files to run the code: EmbryoNet.py and embryo_tools.py
